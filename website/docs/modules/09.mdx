# Module 09 (in development)

Visualize SVs with
[IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)
screenshots and read depth plots.

Visualization methods include:
* RD Visualization - generate RD plots across all
samples, ideal for visualizing large CNVs.
* IGV Visualization - generate IGV plots of each
SV for individual sample, ideal for visualizing
de novo small SVs.
* Module09.visualize.wdl - generate RD plots and
IGV plots, and combine them for easy review.
