# Module 08 (in development)

Add annotations, such as the inferred function
and allele frequencies of variants, to final vcf.

Annotations methods include:
* Functional annotation - annotate SVs with
inferred function on protein coding regions,
regulatory regions such as UTR and Promoters
and other non coding elements;
* Allele Frequency annotation - annotate SVs
with their allele frequencies across all samples,
and samples of specific sex, as well as specific
sub-populations.
* Allele Frequency annotation with external
callset - annotate SVs with the allele frequencies
of their overlapping SVs in another callset,
eg. gnomad SV callset.
