# Module 00b

Runs ploidy estimation, dosage scoring, and
optionally VCF QC. The results from this
module can be used for QC and batching.

For large cohorts, we recommend dividing
samples into smaller batches (~500 samples)
with ~1:1 male:female ratio.

We also recommend using sex assignments generated
from the ploidy estimates and incorporating
them into the PED file.

## Prerequisites:
* [Module 00a](00a)

## Inputs:
* Read count files ([Module 00a](00a))
* (Optional) SV call VCFs ([Module 00a](00a))

## Outputs:
* Per-sample dosage scores with plots
* Ploidy estimates, sex assignments, with plots
* (Optional) Outlier samples detected by call counts


## gCNV Training
Trains a gCNV model for use in [Module 00c](00c).
The WDL can be found at `/gcnv/trainGCNV.wdl`.

### Prerequisites:
* [Module 00a](00a)
* (Recommended) [Module 00b](00b)

### Inputs:
* Read count files ([Module 00a](00a))

### Outputs:
* Contig ploidy model tarball
* gCNV model tarballs
